# mirazhossain.com — full site

Static website for Md. Miraz Hossain. The current information architecture keeps the public navigation focused on Research, Academic, Reportage, Interventions, and About, with services, credentials, projects, and the personal "Beyond the work" room tucked into those sections.

## How to update content

Every dynamic section is driven by a JSON file in `content/`. Adding an article or certificate means editing one JSON file — no HTML changes needed.

**Add a new article:** open `content/articles.json`, add an object like:
```json
{
  "title": "Your new piece title",
  "date": "2026-05-01",
  "link": "https://...",
  "outlet": "The Business Standard"
}
```

**Add a new certificate:** open `content/certificates.json`:
```json
{
  "title": "Certificate name",
  "issuer": "Coursera / University X",
  "date": "May 01, 2026",
  "theme": "Research & Data"
}
```

Known themes: `Journalism & Fact-Checking`, `Research & Data`, `Science, Data & Technology`, `English Language & Communication`, `Career Development & Productivity`, `Project Management & Leadership`, `Negotiation & Conflict Resolution`, `Philosophy, Religion & Ethics`, `Psychology & Mental Health`, `Business & Economics`, `Language Learning`, `Awards & Recognition`. New themes will appear automatically at the bottom of the `/credentials/` page.

## Local preview

The site uses `fetch()` to load JSON, so opening the HTML directly via `file://` won't show the dynamic content. Either:

1. **Quick preview** — from this folder, run:
   ```
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   then open http://localhost:8000

2. **Or just upload it to ExonHost** — everything works as soon as it's on a real web server.

## Deploy to ExonHost

Two options:

**Option A — File Manager (easiest)**
1. Log into your ExonHost cPanel.
2. Open **File Manager** → navigate to `public_html/`.
3. (Optional) Back up your existing files first — download them as a ZIP from File Manager.
4. Upload the `mirazhossain-site.zip` into `public_html/`.
5. Right-click the ZIP → **Extract** → extract directly into `public_html/` (or a subfolder if you want to keep the old site temporarily).
6. If extracted into a subfolder, move the files up one level or update your domain root.
7. Visit mirazhossain.com — you should see the new site.

**Option B — FTP**
Use FileZilla or similar. Connect with the FTP credentials from your ExonHost welcome email. Upload all files from this folder into `public_html/`.

## Keeping the old site as a fallback

While testing, you can deploy the new site to a subfolder like `public_html/new/` and view it at `mirazhossain.com/new/` — once you're happy, move it to the root.
